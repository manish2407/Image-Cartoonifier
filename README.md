# Image-Cartoonifier

MOTIVATION -

Cartoons are commonly used in various kinds of applications. As we know cartoons are artistically made it requires elegant and fine human artistic skills. While portraying Cartoons in humongous numbers for any animated movies it gets time-consuming for the artist as they need to define the sketch of the cartoon properly to get a good result. Aim of the project is to put forward a solution for transforming snapshots or videos of real-world into animated photos (Cartoon Images) or videos. 

The earlier method of transformation requires complicated computer graphics and skills. The idea of this project is based on designated snapshots and videos which are converted to an art form such as painting. Amongst all the techniques usable, the application of a OpenCV library of python and Digital Image Processing concepts will be used for the styling real-world images. The development of the project shows that our Proposed Idea provides high quality cartooned images and videos.
